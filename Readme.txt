VISUAL LIFECYCLE STATUS

Introduction:
---------------------------------------------
When using Vault to manage a product’s lifecycle, you know the status that your products are currently in, but you may not have a big picture about the product’s lifecycle management. Visual Lifecycle Status is a tool to show you the big picture of the product lifecycle. With Visual Lifecycle Status, you can easily understand where the product is and where it can move forward. Meanwhile, it provides an easy way to change the lifecycle within the tab view.
